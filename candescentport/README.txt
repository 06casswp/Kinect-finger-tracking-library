This project has dependencies, they are Ogre 1.6 and CEGUI 0.7.6 and OpenNI 1.5.2.23 or later!

In order for the drivers to work correctly, there must be only 1 kinect driver installed. 
The recommended installations are OpenNI 1.5.2.23, Primesense NITE 1.5.2.21, Primesense Sensor Kinectmod 5.0.3.3
Please note that in order for the system to work, a Kinect Camera device must be correctly operating in device manager. Multiple drivers, incorrect setup and failed libraries can result in the Kinect being unconnectable.
Also, a kinect that doesnt have its power cable plugged in may also result in difficulties as it will also not be connectable.
